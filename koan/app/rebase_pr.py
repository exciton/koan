"""
Kōan -- Pull Request rebase workflow.

Rebases a PR branch onto its target branch, analyzing review comments
and applying requested changes via Claude before pushing.

Pipeline:
1. Fetch PR metadata + comments from GitHub
2. Checkout the PR branch locally
3. Rebase onto the upstream target branch (resolving conflicts via Claude if needed)
4. Analyze review comments and apply changes (Claude-powered, if feedback exists)
5. Force-push to the existing branch (never creates a new PR)
6. Comment on the PR with a summary

"""Restart signal management for Kōan processes.

Provides file-based restart signaling between bridge and run loop.

Two consumers (bridge and runner) each get their own marker so a fast
wrapper-restart of the runner can no longer wipe the signal before the
bridge's polling tick sees it.

The restart flow:
1. ``request_restart`` writes ``.koan-restart-bridge`` and ``.koan-restart-run``.
2. Bridge's main loop notices ``.koan-restart-bridge`` and re-execs via
   ``os.execv`` (same PID, fresh interpreter).
3. Runner's main loop notices ``.koan-restart-run`` and exits with
   ``RESTART_EXIT_CODE``; its wrapper relaunches it.
4. Each process clears only its own marker on startup, so neither can
   silence the signal for the other.

Legacy ``.koan-restart`` (DEPRECATED): the single combined marker is no
longer *written* by Kōan. It is read by nothing in-tree (both consumers poll
their own per-process marker), so writing it was a no-op that lingered on disk.
``check_restart``/``clear_restart`` still accept ``target=None`` → ``.koan-restart``
purely so any out-of-tree script polling the old path keeps working; remove that
mapping once you are certain no external consumer depends on it. All in-tree
restart triggers (run loop, bridge, auto-update, REST API, dashboard) now go
through ``request_restart`` so both consumer markers are written and the restart
actually fires.

Exit code 42 is the restart sentinel — any other exit is a real stop.

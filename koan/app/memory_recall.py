"""Task-aware memory recall — score and filter project learnings by mission relevance.

Lightweight Jaccard-similarity scoring (no external dependencies) used by
``prompt_builder`` to keep the injected learnings section under
``memory.max_relevant_learnings`` lines. A small "recency hedge" always keeps
the most recent learnings regardless of score so freshly-captured lessons
are never dropped.

The scoring is deterministic given the same inputs and is intentionally
simple: tokenize → lowercase → drop stopwords → set intersection / union.
For larger semantic recall use #1309 (token-budget-aware trimming) or a
proper vector store; this module just removes the obvious noise.

        * The recency hedge is taken *after* selection so duplicates are
          collapsed — asking for ``max_k=40, recent_hedge=5`` may return
          fewer than 45 lines if the last 5 lines were already in the top-K.

"""GitHub command handler — bridges notifications to missions and replies.

Orchestrates the full flow from a GitHub @mention notification to either:
- A queued mission in missions.md (for recognized commands)
- A direct AI-generated reply (for questions/requests from authorized users)

Command flow:
1. Parse comment → extract command
2. Validate command → check skill has github_enabled
3. Check permissions → verify user is authorized
4. Add reaction → mark as processed (👍)
5. Build mission → format with project tag
6. Insert mission → write to missions.md

Reply flow (when reply_enabled=true and command not recognized):
1. Verify user is authorized
2. Fetch issue/PR thread context
3. Generate AI reply via Claude CLI
4. Post reply as GitHub comment

Kōan — Crash recovery

Detects missions left in "In Progress" from a previous interrupted run.
Classifies each stale mission and takes appropriate action:

  - dead:          Standard crash — move back to Pending
  - partial:       Interrupted run with pending.md context — recover with context
  - unrecoverable: Too many recovery attempts — move to Failed, notify human

Recovery attempts are now tracked in the stagnation_monitor tracker
(instance/.stagnation-retries.json), keyed by mission title. The legacy
[r:N] tag embedded in mission text is still supported for backward
compatibility — if a mission carries an [r:N] tag from a previous Kōan
version and that count exceeds the tracker value, the tag value is used
instead. New missions will not have [r:N] tags written back to missions.md.

All recovery events are logged to instance/recovery.jsonl for forensics.

Complex mission format (### project:X sub-headers in In Progress):
The ### block format is used for multi-step missions that group related sub-tasks
under a project sub-header.  Recovery handles these as atomic blocks — the entire
block is either requeued to Pending or escalated to Failed together.  The block
boundary ends at the next blank line or the next ### header, whichever comes first.
This is a second safety net; the primary is that start_mission() flushes stale
In Progress entries to Failed via _flush_in_progress_to_failed().

Usage from shell:
    python3 recover.py /path/to/instance [--dry-run]

Returns via stdout:
    Number of recovered missions (0 if none).
    Missions file is updated in-place if recovery happens.

    All events are logged to recovery.jsonl for forensics.

    Uses the mission store's locked_store() context manager for an atomic
    load → mutate → save cycle under exclusive lock, preventing race conditions
    with concurrent mission additions.

    This is the *primary* crash-recovery safety net — it runs once at startup,

    in ``missions._flush_in_progress_to_failed`` (invoked per-mission by

    ``###`` blocks) into Failed. If you are debugging a stale In Progress

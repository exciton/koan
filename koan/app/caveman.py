"""Kōan — Caveman output optimization helpers.

Single source of truth for "should the caveman directive be appended to this
prompt?".  The directive (no filler, 3-6 word sentences, direct answers) lives
in ``koan/system-prompts/caveman-mode.md`` and is injected at three Claude
entry points:

- The agent loop (``app.prompt_builder._get_caveman_section``)
- Skill runners loaded via ``app.prompts.load_prompt_or_skill`` /
  ``app.prompts.load_skill_prompt``
- The chat handler (``app.awake._build_chat_prompt``)

Per-skill semantics are **opt-in**: skills do not get caveman unless they
explicitly request it.  A skill opts in via either:

1. ``caveman: true`` in its ``SKILL.md`` frontmatter (skill author declares
   the skill benefits from terse output), or
2. The skill's canonical name is listed in
   ``optimizations.caveman.include`` in ``config.yaml`` (instance owner
   overrides).

The agent loop (regular missions, no associated skill) is gated only by the
global ``optimizations.caveman.enabled`` flag — this preserves the
high-volume token savings shipped in PR #1279.

Aliases (e.g. ``deeplan``) are resolved to canonical names (``deepplan``)
before matching.

Kōan -- Implement runner.

Reads a GitHub issue containing a plan and invokes Claude to implement it.
The runner extracts the most recent plan iteration from the issue (body or
latest plan comment), ignoring older content, and feeds it to Claude with
an optional user-provided context (e.g. "Phase 1 to 3").

CLI:
    python3 -m skills.core.implement.implement_runner --project-path <path> --issue-url <url>
    python3 -m skills.core.implement.implement_runner --project-path <path> --issue-url <url> --context "Phase 1 to 3"
    python3 -m skills.core.implement.implement_runner --project-path <path> --project-name <name> --issue-url <url>

## Your mission

Dive deep into the codebase. Read key files, understand patterns, and identify opportunities.

Think about:
- UX improvements that would make the developer's life better
- Code quality issues or technical debt worth addressing
- Missing features suggested by the patterns you see
- Low-effort, high-impact changes ("quick wins")
- Things that feel inconsistent or could be simplified
- Security or reliability concerns

Use the project memory and health data above to avoid suggesting improvements that have
already been explored, already failed, or are already known pain points. Your output uses
structured `---IDEA---` blocks (see format below) — cross-reference each idea against
the learnings and failure patterns to ensure you're proposing fresh opportunities the
project hasn't tried yet.

Suggest **3-5 concrete, actionable ideas**, ranked by impact. For each:
- A clear one-line description of the change
- Why it matters (what it improves, what risk it reduces)
- An estimate of effort (quick win / medium / significant)

Rules:
- Be specific, not generic. "Add error handling" is boring. "The retry logic in X silently swallows Y" is useful.
- Read actual code before suggesting — don't guess from file names alone.
- Prioritize ideas the human wouldn't think of themselves.
- Don't suggest things already in progress (check missions context above).
- Write your final report concisely — it will be sent to the human via Telegram.

External project constraints:
- **CI matrix**: never remove existing entries from CI test matrices (Python versions, OS targets, etc.). You may add new entries. Existing targets are deliberate choices by the maintainer.
- **Dependencies**: don't remove or downgrade existing dependencies without explicit justification.
- **Conventions**: respect the project's existing code style, naming, and structure even if you'd do it differently.

## Output format

At the END of your response, after your human-readable report, output each actionable idea
as a structured `---IDEA---` block. Each block is parsed programmatically — use the exact
field names and separator format shown below.

```
---IDEA---
TITLE: Fix the retry logic in fetch_data() which silently swallows ConnectionError
IMPACT: high
EFFORT: quick_win
CATEGORY: quality
LOCATION: src/api/client.py:42-58
DESCRIPTION: The retry wrapper catches all exceptions including ConnectionError, hiding transient network failures from callers. This means broken connections are silently retried without logging, making production debugging impossible.
---IDEA---
TITLE: Add input validation for user email in registration endpoint
IMPACT: high
EFFORT: medium
CATEGORY: security
LOCATION: src/routes/auth.py:115
DESCRIPTION: The email field is passed directly to the ORM query without sanitization. While the ORM parameterizes queries, the lack of format validation allows malformed emails to pollute the users table.
---IDEA---
TITLE: Extract duplicated date formatting from controllers into shared utility
IMPACT: low
EFFORT: quick_win
CATEGORY: quality
LOCATION: src/controllers/orders.py:89, src/controllers/invoices.py:34, src/controllers/reports.py:67
DESCRIPTION: Three controllers each implement their own strftime formatting with slightly different format strings. A shared helper would ensure consistency and reduce maintenance surface.

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Values |
|-------|----------|--------|
| TITLE | yes | One-line description — specific enough to execute as a standalone mission |
| IMPACT | yes | `high` / `medium` / `low` — how much value does fixing this deliver? |
| EFFORT | yes | `quick_win` / `medium` / `significant` |
| CATEGORY | yes | `perf` / `quality` / `feature` / `security` |
| LOCATION | yes | File path with line numbers (e.g. `src/foo.py:42` or `src/foo.py:42-58`). Multiple locations comma-separated |
| DESCRIPTION | yes | 2-3 sentences: what's wrong and why it matters. Must be self-contained — a future agent will use this without re-reading your exploration |

### Rules for ---IDEA--- blocks
- Use `---IDEA---` as the exact separator between blocks (no variations)
- One block per idea
- Be specific in TITLE: mention file names, function names, or patterns you found
- LOCATION must reference actual files and lines you verified by reading the code
- No `[project:name]` tag in TITLE (added automatically)
- Only output ideas you're confident are worth implementing

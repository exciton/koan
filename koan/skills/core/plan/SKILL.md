## Options

- `--iterations N` (1-5, default 1): Run N rounds of plan generation. After the initial plan, a critic identifies content gaps and contradictions, then the plan is regenerated with that feedback. Only the final iteration is posted. Cost scales linearly — `--iterations 3` uses ~5× the tokens of a standard plan call.

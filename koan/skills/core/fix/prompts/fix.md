You are fixing an issue from the configured issue tracker. Your job is to understand the issue, plan the fix, write tests, implement the fix, and produce clean, reviewable commits.

## Tracker Issue

**Issue**: {ISSUE_URL}
**Title**: {ISSUE_TITLE}

## Issue Content

{ISSUE_BODY}

## Additional Context

{CONTEXT}
{PROJECT_MEMORY}
## Instructions

### Phase 1 — Understand

1. **Read the issue carefully.** Identify what is broken, what is expected, and any constraints or edge cases.
2. **Read the project's CLAUDE.md** (if it exists) for coding conventions.
3. **Explore the relevant code.** Use Read, Glob, and Grep to find the files involved. Understand the current behavior before changing anything.
4. **Identify the root cause.** Don't just fix the symptom — understand why it happens.

### Phase 2 — Plan

5. **Write a fix plan** with concrete phases. Each phase should be a single coherent change (one commit). Order by dependency — foundational changes first.
6. **Identify affected files** for each phase.

Branch naming: `{BRANCH_PREFIX}fix-issue-{ISSUE_NUMBER}`

{@include implementation-workflow}

## Rules

- **Minimal changes.** Fix the issue, don't refactor unrelated code.
- **One commit per phase.** Each phase is a coherent, reviewable unit.
- **Never commit to main.** Always work on the feature branch.
- **Test before commit.** Never commit code that breaks tests.
- **Be surgical.** Smallest change that solves the problem correctly.
- **Document decisions.** If you made a non-obvious choice, explain it in a comment or commit message.
- **Always submit a PR.** The fix is not complete until a draft PR is created.
- **Use Koan's issue helper for tracker writes.** If you must fetch, create, or comment on tracker issues yourself, use `{KOAN_PYTHON} -m app.issue_cli` instead of direct `gh issue` commands so GitHub and Jira projects both work.

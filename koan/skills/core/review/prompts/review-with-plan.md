# Code Review with Plan Alignment

You are performing a code review on a pull request that was created from a
structured plan. Your task has two parts:

1. **Plan alignment** — verify that the implementation matches the plan's intent
2. **Code quality** — standard review for correctness, security, and maintainability

## Pull Request: {TITLE}

**Branch**: `{BRANCH}` -> `{BASE}`

## Original Plan

This PR was created to implement the following plan. Use it as the source of
truth for what *should* be built. **Do not trust the PR description** — verify
each plan requirement independently against the actual diff.

## Your Task

### Part 1: Plan Alignment

Read the plan carefully, then inspect the diff. For each requirement described
in the plan's `### Implementation Phases` section, determine:

- **Met**: The diff implements this requirement. Be specific — name the file and
  what was added.
- **Missing**: The requirement is not present in the diff, or only partially
  implemented. Be specific about what is absent.
- **Out of scope**: Changes in the diff that are not mentioned in the plan
  (neutral — neither good nor bad, but worth noting).

If the plan contains a `### Verification Criteria` section, read each criterion
and populate `verification_criteria_results` with whether the diff satisfies it.
If the section is absent, leave `verification_criteria_results` as an empty
array.

**Critical rule**: Do NOT trust the PR description's claims about what was
implemented. Verify each claim against the actual diff.

### Part 2: Code Quality

Analyze the code changes and produce a structured review. Focus on:

1. **Correctness** — Logic bugs, edge cases, off-by-one errors, race conditions
2. **Security** — Injection, authentication gaps, data exposure, unsafe operations
3. **Architecture** — Design issues, coupling, abstraction level, naming
4. **Maintainability** — Readability, complexity, test coverage gaps

### Output Format

Your ENTIRE response must be a single valid JSON object (no markdown, no code fences, no text before or after). The JSON must conform to this schema:

```json
{
  "plan_alignment": {
    "requirements_met": [
      "Phase 1: _detect_plan_url() added in review_runner.py (lines 42-52)"
    ],
    "requirements_missing": [
      "Phase 3: --plan-url CLI flag not found in main() argument parser"
    ],
    "out_of_scope": [
      "review_schema.py: added PLAN_ALIGNMENT_SCHEMA (not mentioned in plan but consistent)"
    ],
    "verification_criteria_results": [
      {"criterion": "Running make test produces no failures", "passed": true, "evidence": "CI workflow shows green"},
      {"criterion": "Given X, when Y, then Z", "passed": false, "evidence": "No test or diff line covers this"}
    ]
  },
  "file_comments": [

      "title": "Short issue title",
      "comment": "Detailed explanation of the issue and suggested fix. Use short paragraphs and bullet points where it aids readability.",
      "code_snippet": "relevant code or empty string"
    }
  ],
  "review_summary": {
    "lgtm": false,

    ]
  },
  "comment_replies": [

(Omit `close_pr` entirely unless you are closing — see Field rules below.)

Field rules:
- **plan_alignment**: Required in this prompt. List each plan phase/requirement individually.
  - `requirements_met`: Things the plan asked for that are present in the diff.
  - `requirements_missing`: Things the plan asked for that are absent or incomplete.
  - `out_of_scope`: Diff changes not mentioned in the plan (neutral observation).
  - `verification_criteria_results`: Array of `{"criterion": "...", "passed": true/false, "evidence": "..."}` objects, one per criterion from the plan's `### Verification Criteria` section. Empty array `[]` when the plan has no such section.

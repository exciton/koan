"""Koan gh_request skill — route natural-language GitHub requests.

When a user posts a free-form request via GitHub @mention (with
natural_language enabled), this skill classifies the intent and
queues the appropriate specific mission (fix, rebase, review, etc.).

This replaces the broken path where natural-language @mentions were
classified as e.g. /fix without the required issue URL, causing
"⚠️ /fix needs a GitHub issue URL to run."

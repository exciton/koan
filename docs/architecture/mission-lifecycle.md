# Mission Lifecycle

`koan/app/missions.py` is the source of truth for parsing and mutating
`instance/missions.md`.

## Queue Format

Missions are stored in Markdown sections. The canonical lifecycle is:

- Pending
- In Progress
- Done
- Failed

French section names are also accepted for compatibility. Missions can include
project tags such as `[project:name]`.

## Normal Execution

1. The bridge, a command handler, a scheduler, or a GitHub/Jira notification
   appends a pending mission.
2. The agent loop picks a mission during an iteration.
3. `start_mission()` moves it from Pending to In Progress and applies sanity
   checks for stale in-progress work.
4. `mission_runner.py` resolves direct skill dispatch or provider execution.
5. The mission is completed, failed, archived, retried, or requeued based on the
   result and configured guards.
6. Post-mission reflection, journal writing, PR creation, security review, and
   auto-merge checks run only when their conditions apply.

## Direct Skill Missions

`skill_dispatch.py` detects slash-command missions that can run without a full
LLM agent session. These runners handle commands such as planning, rebasing,
recreating, checking, and CLAUDE.md refresh flows. Prompt-only or unsupported
missions continue through the configured provider.

## Scheduled And Recurring Work

- One-shot scheduled missions live under `instance/events/` and are consumed by
  `event_scheduler.py`.
- Recurring work is injected by the iteration path through recurring scheduler
  helpers.
- Suggestion generation can propose automation but should not silently enable it.

## Recovery And Retries

Crash recovery moves stale In Progress work back to a safe state. Stagnation
retries are tracked separately so a stuck provider session can be retried a
limited number of times before regular failure handling and user notification.

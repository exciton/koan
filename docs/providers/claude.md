# Claude Code CLI Provider

The Claude Code CLI is Koan's default and most capable provider. It gives
the agent full access to Claude's reasoning, tool use, and multi-turn
conversation capabilities.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Claude Code CLI

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
claude --version
```

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
claude
```

Follow the interactive login flow. Once authenticated, your credentials
are stored in `~/.claude/` and persist across sessions.

### 3. Configure Koan

Claude is the default provider — no extra configuration is needed.
If you've previously changed the provider, set it back:

In `config.yaml`:

```yaml
cli_provider: "claude"
```

Or via environment variable (in `.env`):

```bash
KOAN_CLI_PROVIDER=claude
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
claude -p "Hello, what model are you?"
```

If this returns a response, you're ready to run Koan.

## Model Configuration

Koan uses different models for different tasks. Configure them in
`config.yaml`:

```yaml
models:
  mission: ""              # Main mission execution (empty = subscription default)
  chat: ""                 # Telegram/dashboard chat responses
  lightweight: "haiku"     # Low-cost calls: formatting, classification
  fallback: "sonnet"       # Fallback when primary model is overloaded
  review_mode: ""          # Override model for REVIEW mode
```

Empty strings use your subscription's default model. Common overrides:

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Complex missions | `opus` | Best reasoning for architectural work |
| Cost-efficient missions | `sonnet` | Good balance for routine tasks |
| Chat responses | `haiku` | Fast, cheap for quick answers |
| Code review | `sonnet` | Sufficient for review, saves quota |

### Per-Project Model Overrides

Different projects can use different models. In `projects.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  critical-backend:
    path: "/path/to/backend"
    models:
      mission: "opus"         # Use Opus for complex backend work
      review_mode: "sonnet"   # Sonnet for reviews

  small-library:
    path: "/path/to/lib"
    models:
      mission: "sonnet"       # Sonnet is sufficient here
```

## Tool Configuration

Control which tools the agent can use:

```yaml
tools:
  chat: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]                          # Read-only for Telegram
  mission: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Edit", "Write", "Bash"]  # Full access for missions
```

Available tools: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash`.

### Per-Project Tool Restrictions

Restrict tools for sensitive repos in `projects.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  vendor-lib:
    path: "/path/to/vendor"
    tools:
      mission: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]  # Read-only — no modifications
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom CLI Binary

You can point Koan at a custom Claude-compatible binary instead of the
default `claude` command. Set `KOAN_CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` in your `.env`:

```bash
KOAN_CLAUDE_CLI_PATH=/path/to/my-claude-wrapper
```

The custom binary must accept the same CLI interface as `claude`
(e.g., `my-wrapper --model <model> -p "prompt"`). This is useful for:

- Using a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` via a wrapper script
- Adding default arguments or environment variables
- Proxying through a custom API endpoint

When unset or empty, Koan uses the standard `claude` command from PATH.

> **Running OpenRouter models through the Claude CLI?** See
> [openrouter.md](openrouter.md) — it uses this wrapper mechanism plus a local
> CCR router to make non-Anthropic OpenRouter models work in `-p` mode.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

Claude Code supports MCP servers for extended capabilities (browser,
databases, APIs). Add MCP config file paths to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# config.yaml — global MCP servers for all projects
mcp:
  - "/path/to/mcp-config.json"
```

Per-project overrides are supported in `projects.yaml` — a project-level
`mcp` list replaces the global list entirely:

```yaml
# projects.yaml — project-specific MCP servers
projects:
  my-project:
    path: "/home/user/my-project"
    mcp:
      - "/path/to/project-specific-mcp.json"
```

The MCP config files use the standard Claude Code JSON format (same as
`~/.claude/mcp.json` or `--mcp-config` flag).

#### Permissions for MCP Tools

When Koan runs as a systemd service (or any non-interactive context),
Claude CLI cannot prompt for tool approval. MCP tools will be
**silently denied** unless pre-approved.

> **Note:** `skip_permissions: true` does **not** work when Koan runs
> as root — Claude CLI rejects `--dangerously-skip-permissions` with
> root/sudo privileges. You must use the allowlist approach below.

To pre-approve MCP tools, create a `.claude/settings.local.json` file
**in the target project's root directory** (the `path` from
`projects.yaml`). This file is loaded by Claude CLI when it runs with
that project as its working directory.

Example — allowlisting the Atlassian MCP server's Jira tools:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__atlassian__getAccessibleAtlassianResources",
      "mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue",
      "mcp__atlassian__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql",
      "mcp__atlassian__getVisibleJiraProjects",
      "mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssueTypeMetaWithFields",
      "mcp__atlassian__getJiraProjectIssueTypesMetadata",
      "mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue",
      "mcp__atlassian__editJiraIssue",
      "mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue",
      "mcp__atlassian__getTransitionsForJiraIssue",
      "mcp__atlassian__transitionJiraIssue",
      "mcp__atlassian__lookupJiraAccountId",
      "mcp__atlassian__getIssueLinkTypes",
      "mcp__atlassian__createIssueLink",
      "mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssueRemoteIssueLinks",
      "mcp__atlassian__searchAtlassian",
      "mcp__atlassian__fetchAtlassian",
      "mcp__atlassian__atlassianUserInfo"
    ]
  }
}
```

The tool name format is `mcp__<server-name>__<toolName>` where
`<server-name>` matches the key in your MCP config JSON (e.g.,
`"atlassian"` in `~/.claude.json`). To find the exact tool names,
run Claude CLI interactively once — denied tools appear in the JSON
output under `permission_denials`.

**Setup checklist for each project using MCP:**

1. Add the MCP config path to `projects.yaml` (under the project's
   `mcp:` key) or globally in `config.yaml`
2. Create `<project-path>/.claude/settings.local.json` with the
   tool allowlist
3. Restart Koan (`systemctl restart koan.service`)

### Max Turns

The `max_turns` setting controls how many tool-use rounds Claude gets
per invocation. Koan sets sensible defaults per context (missions get
more turns than chat). You generally don't need to change this.

### Output Format

Claude Code supports JSON output (`--output-format json`) which Koan
uses internally for structured mission results. This is handled
automatically.

### Fallback Model

When the primary model is rate-limited or unavailable, Koan falls back
to the configured fallback model:

```yaml
models:
  fallback: "sonnet"  # Used when primary model is overloaded
```

This is a Claude-specific feature — other providers don't support it.

## Troubleshooting

### "claude: command not found"

The CLI is not installed or not in your PATH.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

If installed via a version manager (nvm, fnm), make sure the right
Node.js version is active.

### Authentication expired

Re-authenticate:

```bash
claude
```

Or check your credentials:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/
```

### Rate limiting / quota exhaustion

Koan monitors quota and pauses automatically when limits are approached.
Check your usage:

```bash
# Via Telegram
/quota

# Or check Claude's stats
claude usage
```

### "Reached max turns" errors

If you see this in logs, the agent ran out of allowed tool-use rounds.
This is normal for complex tasks — Koan handles it gracefully and
reports partial results.

## Devcontainer Mode

When a project has a `.devcontainer/` setup, Kōan can execute Claude inside
the devcontainer so the agent has access to the full runtime — Ruby, bundled
gems, databases, language toolchains, and anything else the container provides.

### Prerequisites

Install the devcontainer CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

Verify:

```bash
devcontainer --version
```

### Configuration

In `projects.yaml`, set `devcontainer: true` for the project:

```yaml
projects:
  my-ruby-app:
    path: "/home/user/workspace/my-ruby-app"
    devcontainer: true
```

You can also set it in `defaults:` to enable it for all projects.

### What Kōan injects

Kōan never writes or modifies any files in your project. Before each mission it
passes CLI flags directly to `devcontainer up`:

- `--additional-features` — adds three features on top of whatever your devcontainer
  already has:
  - `ghcr.io/exciton/devcontainer-features/claude-code-config-bind-mount:latest` — bind-mounts `~/.claude` from the host and creates the in-container symlink (handled at container build time by this feature)
  - `ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1` — installs Claude Code CLI
  - `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1` — installs `gh` CLI (Claude uses it for PRs, issues, CI checks)
- `--mount` (×2) — bind-mounts two host directories into the container:
  - `KOAN_ROOT/instance/` → `/mnt/koan-instance` — agent memory, soul, missions
  - `KOAN_ROOT/devcontainer-tmp/` → `/mnt/koan-tmp` — temp files (system prompts, plugin dirs)

After the container starts, Kōan runs two post-start steps via `devcontainer exec`:

1. If a GitHub token is available and the tmp mount is in place: writes the token to a temp file inside `/mnt/koan-tmp/` and runs `gh auth login --with-token` inside the container to authenticate `gh`. The file is deleted immediately after.
2. Runs `gh auth setup-git` as the container user to configure the git HTTPS credential helper so `git push` works with the host's GitHub token.

The agent prompt uses container-native paths (`/mnt/koan-instance`, `/workspaces/<name>`) so Claude never references host-side paths it can't reach.

### How execution works

Before each mission on a devcontainer-enabled project, Kōan:

1. Creates `KOAN_ROOT/devcontainer-tmp/` if it doesn't exist
2. Runs `devcontainer up` with mounts and features (idempotent — reuses running containers)
3. Runs post-start credential setup: `gh auth login --with-token` (if a token is available) + `gh auth setup-git` (via `devcontainer exec`)
4. Runs the mission as: `devcontainer exec --workspace-folder <path> -- claude <args>`

### If the container was created before Kōan managed it

Mounts are only applied at container creation time. If you previously started the
devcontainer yourself (via VS Code or directly), those mounts won't be present.
Remove the old container to force recreation:

```bash
docker ps -a --filter label=devcontainer.local_folder=<absolute_project_path> --format '{{.ID}}'
docker rm <container_id>
```

The next mission run will recreate the container with the correct mounts.

### Fallback behaviour

If `devcontainer: true` is set but `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` does not
exist in the project, Kōan logs a warning and falls back to running Claude on
the host. No error is raised — the mission proceeds normally.

### Known limitations

- **`KOAN_PYTHON -m app.issue_cli`** (used for Jira issue fetching) will not
  work inside a devcontainer in v1. Kōan's Python venv is not mounted in the
  container. All other operations (git, gh, project tooling) work normally.

### Out of scope

- Multi-container (docker-compose-based) devcontainer setups
- Parallel sessions (worktrees) inside devcontainers
- Auto-installing `@devcontainers/cli` — Kōan fails fast with a clear install
  hint if the CLI is not found
